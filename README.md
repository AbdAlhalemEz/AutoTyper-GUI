# AutoTyper GUI

AutoTyper GUI is a Python application that automatically types text letter by letter into any active window. Itâ€™s useful for chat apps that block pasting or for automating repetitive typing tasks.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface (GUI):** Easy-to-use textbox for entering your text.
- **Adjustable Typing Delay:** Control the speed of typing per character.
- **Prep Time:** Set a countdown before typing starts, giving you time to focus the target window.
- **Multi-line Support:** Works with paragraphs and multiple lines of text.
- **Standalone Executable:** Can be converted to a Windows `.exe` for use without Python installed.

## Convert to Windows Executable (Optional)

You can create a standalone `.exe` file using PyInstaller:

```

- The `.exe` will be in the `dist` folder.
- It runs on any Windows machine without Python installed.
